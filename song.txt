You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

Hey, baby love I need a girl like you
But tell me if you feel it too
I'm in delusion every minute every hour
My heart is crying out for you

CHORUS
Get down, get down and move it all around (x4)
Ooh baby you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

Bang, bang, bang
Here we come, here we slam
It's the FunFactory with the BSB's
Get on your knees
Tryin' to scream
Or touch me please
Backstreet boys are you with it (yeah)
A.J. hit it
