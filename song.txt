You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

Hey, baby love I need a girl like you
But tell me if you feel it too
I'm in delusion every minute every hour
My heart is crying out for you

CHORUS
Get down, get down and move it all around (x4)
Ooh baby you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need
